# US-Wildfire-Project
Objective of the project is to tame wildfires in USA by learning wildfire trends each year.
Performed descriptive analysis and data visualization to answer common questions like largest fire, fire city, fire range using PostgreSQL sqllite3 python package.
Built time series models AR and ARIMA to forecast fire occurrence in future for a state which resulted in RMSE value of 1237 for ARIMA performing better than AR.
